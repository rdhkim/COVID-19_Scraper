# COVID-19_Scraper
A web scraping project to get data on current COVID-19 stats in Ontario.

Finds and exports the COVID-19 table found at https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19 into an excel sheet.

Possible routes for expanding project
- Email out daily changes or email out based on a high % change in number of cases
- Instead of exporting to excel, use twitter api to send a tweet out daily on updates
